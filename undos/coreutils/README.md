# Coreutils

This directory contains the undo files for some of the most often used commands provided by [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/),
most of which deal with file creation and manipulation.

Many commands are omitted such as `ls` since it does not do anything that can be truly undone.

Other commands like `rm` are also omitted since there is no reliable way to undo it across most platforms.
